## Welcome to oiroirbeebee!

This repository contains the code for FTC Team 8565's oiroirbeebee app, the fastest way to prototype and export Roadrunner paths!

### Quick info about the source code

[oiroirbeebee-vanilla](https://github.com/Leppy-oss/oiroirbeebee/oiroirbeebee-vanilla)
contains code in vanilla Javascript to instantly deploy the app in any browser on any computer, locally, without any setup.

[oiroirbeebee-turbopack](https://github.com/Leppy-oss/oiroirbeebee/oiroirbeebee-turbopack)
is based on Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is still in development.

## NOTICE

Generated paths WILL look slightly different in Roadrunner than in the simulator due to slightly different spline equations.
