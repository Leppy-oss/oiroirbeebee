## Welcome to oiroirbeebee!

This repository contains the code for FTC Team 8565's oiroirbeebee app, the fastest way to prototype and export Roadrunner paths!

### Quick info about the source code

[oiroirbeebee-vanilla](https://github.com/Leppy-oss/oiroirbeebee/oiroirbeebee-vanilla)
contains code in vanilla Javascript to instantly deploy the app in any browser on any computer, locally, without any setup. It lacks many features and should not be used.

[oiroirbeebee-turbopack](https://github.com/Leppy-oss/oiroirbeebee/oiroirbeebee-turbopack)
contains a Turbopack distribution of the oiroirbeebee Node.js app that requires a Node environment and installed packages to set up on a server. It is the most full-fledged and feature rich oiroirbeebee app and should be used if possible. It is built on the Next.js React framework and uses Tailwind.css for styling.
